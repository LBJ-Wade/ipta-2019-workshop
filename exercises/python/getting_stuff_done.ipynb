Fortunately, a lot of stuff has already been written for you, by the Python team and also by many programmers around the world, _including_ intrepid astronomers. To get most of the functionality you might want, you need to import the modules in which it is contained. In this Notebook, we are going to look at importing modules and packages (and subpackages), classes, and how to find out how to do things with the modules you've imported. We'll illustrate all this with some simple examples from the `astropy` package, which is a tool you will use often as an astronomer programming in Python.\n"
