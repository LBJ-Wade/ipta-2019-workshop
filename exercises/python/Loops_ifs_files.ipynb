    "A code block is one or more lines of code that are intended to be executed as a set. For example, a code block may be a function body, or the statements within a loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the C programming language, a code block must be enclosed by a pair of curly brackets, and is often accompanied by (non-required) indentation for clarity to make it easier for humans to read. In Python, however, a code block is defined by the amount of indented space. Lines of code that have an equal amount of indentation, or blank spaces at the start of the line, are in the same code block. In the following example, lines 2 through 4 belong to one code block. \n",

Adding spaces to improve readability in Python may produce syntax errors or, even worse, run time errors that can be very difficult to discover. If you are using a Python-aware development environment, including this Jupyter Notebook, you have probably found that it inserts intelligent indents for you, although sometimes you may need to remove the last one when you've finished a block (you can normally do that with `<shift>-<tab>`)\n",

    "It is important to note that tabs and spaces are interpreted differently in Python. Either tabs or spaces can be used but they should not be mixed (they are not the same thing, and the equivalent number of spaces a tab comprises depends on editor settings, rather than definition). _According to the Style Guide for Python Code, spaces are preferred to tabs._ Most text editors can be set to insert spaces when the tab key is pressed (that should be what happens in these Jupyter Notebooks; have a check!); as per the Python Style Guide, the preferred incremental spacing for successive indentations is **four spaces**.\n"

However, if condition2 turns out to be false, then condition3 is never evaluated and statement3 cannot be reached.\n",
