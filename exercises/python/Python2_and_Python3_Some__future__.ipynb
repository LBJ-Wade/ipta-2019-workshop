    "Python2 and Python3 have some significant differences which generally make code written in one incompatible with running in the interpreter of the other. As an aside, in [semantic versioning](https://semver.org), the first number is the _major version_ and a major version incremement can break calls to the software (Python, in this case) which used to work, or have them produce different output; the number after the point is a minor version, and while this typically involves new functionality, the old calls should still all work as expected. Although software around the world doesn't necessarily obey these rules all of the time, the Python2 vs Python3 transition definitely does result in broken calls, and also calls which no longer behave the same way. This is still an ongoing problem, although not as bad as it used to be."

It can also be important to retain existing versions of Python for system operations (the package manager on Red Hat Enterprise Linux and its derivatives, such as CentOS, depends on a particular version of Python). The use of `virtualenv` is recommended for solving this issue, allowing you to have several applications written for different versions of Python, each runnable with the appropriate interpreter; for this and for other reasons (such as portability), `virtualenv` is an important technology both for Python programmers and the people who run the systems on which they run their code."
