A lot of it uses the file (in this folder) `some_pulsars.txt` (advice on reading text files is given in the notebook [Loops_ifs_files](Loops_ifs_files.ipynb)). Make yourself new Notebooks for addressing these problems!\n",

Start with just a few, say 5 (but don't take them from the first 10, a bunch of them are in a Globular cluster and very close together!). Write some code to find the separations between them. As the distance from puslar 1 to pulsar 2 is the same as the distance from pulsar 2 to pulsar 1, make sure you don't have duplication in your dataset.\n",

    "The most efficient way to observe them, assuming all are equally important and all stay up through the observation (and a bunch of other things; writing optimal observing scripts is _hard_), is to observe in the order which minimises slew time. Write some code, for your pulsars, to minimise that slew time; just assume that the angular separation is the proxy for the slew time (ie, you're trying to minimise the total traversed angular distance over the observing run).\n",

    "_Note_ Although this can be done badly or well, the underlying problem is computationally hard however you do it, and won't scale well! Indeed, it's the Travelling Salesman Problem, a classic NP-complete problem. There are some Python implementations for the Travelling Salesman Problem you can search up online. In big problems, it'd be easier to sacrifice some efficiency for computational tractability. _Hard_: How might you do that? Some ideas may be [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem#Heuristic_and_approximation_algorithms)."
